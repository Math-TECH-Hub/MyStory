Hello friends and Community Members,
I am Gilbert Charles by names but also friends call me Kane, shortened out from the name Kenyi as It's my birth name. 
I am an enthusiastic South Sudanese born in a small Refugee Settlement named Robidire in Adjumani District on 30th November 1998.
Life was good in the beginning with both parents by my side and everything seemed so beautiful, but then as time went on, I realized I was just a kid by then to know
what really life was. As years past on I came to know I wasn't a citizen of the country I was in, but then as a child I had a lot of questions to ask because I wanted to know what
really happened in the past years before I was born that brought about the taking of refuge in Robidire, Adjumani, Uganda.
As life went on I started to learn and hear from my grand parents how they ran into Uganda and how many suffered, the pains they feel as the memories of their lost ones during the war crosses by.
And when 2008 came, Of course repatriation took place, as it was my first time to step in my fatherland South Sudan, Imagining the sweetness of life and love from the natives.
Enjoyed the moments with the family, Of course Boom 2016 comes and I get myself back in Pagirinya Refugee Settlement in Adjumani. What could I say, didn't know the source of the crisis, 
and yeah no power to stop but only had to put down this set of piece to my dear fellow South Sudan seriously.
The piece I titled "LETTER TO THE SOUTH SUDAN SERIOUSLY"
