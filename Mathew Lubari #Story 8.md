My name is Mathew Lubari, 
I am am a South Sudanese leaving in Uganda as a refugee, 
this happened in 2016 when political instability broke out 
between the Spla/Io under the leadership of Dr. Riek machar and 
the Spla government under the leadership of president kir. 
this has forced me and my family to come to Uganda where each of us 
took a different direction in order to save our lives. 
But while in Uganda i got an opportunity to work with one organization 
called RMF and ACF as a volunteer before i joined the organization of 
my dream which is community technology empowerment network(CTEN) where 
i am currently working as an ICT Assistant. working with CTEN has given 
me great opportunities like trainings and Networking with others. 
One of it was the ASKNet training which was conducted by r0g agency in 2018 
where i was able to learn how to build a solar charger using the available resources. 
during the training i worked all the night making a portable solar charger which took 
me about 7hrs where i succeeded in making.this has given courage that when you want 
achieve something, you need to work tirelessly in other to get it done.
